    Hello! I am currently a third year computer engineering student from the University of Toronto. Originally, I was in the TrackOne program but I decided to pursue electrical and computer engineering
    as my main discipline. On my road to discovering my interests during my two years in university, I enjoyed the programming and math courses more than any of my other courses. From debugging many lines of code,
    I find myself to be a patient and analytical thinker. I prefer to work in groups because I like to see many perspectives and confirm my ideas before a plan is set in stone. Currently I am seeking positions
    in software development or data science as those are where my interests lies.

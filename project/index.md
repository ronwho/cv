&nbsp; &nbsp; Group Project `Winter 2019-2020`
: > Direct is a geographical information system that allow users to search for intersections or points of interests (such as restaurants, hospitals, and much more) and also find the shortest route between two intersections by car, walking, or combination of both. It can even compute a rough estimate the time it takes to get to your destination. This was written in C++ and uses EZGL for user interface.
